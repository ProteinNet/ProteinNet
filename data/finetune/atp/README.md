# ATP Bind

This dataset was originally downloaded from ATPBind website (https://zhanggroup.org/ATPbind/).

Despite up-to-date KLIFS version is 3.2, their download code is not user-friendly -- we need extra burden for preprocessing them.

Therefore current repository uses the old version (v1) of KLIFS, which contains small size of dataset but easy to use.

We will start from here, then expand our results to the large dataset.

Download data from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/45414#.YxfvCuxBwUE), then locate the KILIFS_v1.zip file at here.

unzip klifs_v1.zip
